Mechanism Module
================

`Classic Interface <classic.html>`_
-----------------------------------

The classic interface implements several fundamental components for defining kinematics, largely based on the physics and classical mechanics modules in SymPy.

`Joints <joints.html>`_
-----------------------

Mechanical joints are typical of modern multibody software, and combine attributes of the fundamental objects found in the classic interface. A good reference to common joint definitions may be found in the documentation for the open-source Modelica project, in the OpenModelica Mechanics Multibody package. While MOMDYN does not use Modelica  code, I will attempt to use similar terminology and input parameters where applicable.

`Bodies <bodies.html>`_
-----------------------

Bodies are used to define the mass and inertial properties of the model. The most basic body is a Particle, which is a mass that is attached to a Point, without an inertia tensor. Basic RigidBody objects are defined, which also have mass defined at the body's mass-center, and inertia tensors dependent on the body geometry.

`Loads <loads.html>`_
---------------------

Loads are the forces and moments that are exerted on points and frames in the model, respectively.
