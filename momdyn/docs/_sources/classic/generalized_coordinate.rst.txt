Generalized Coordinate
======================

A generalized coordinate is a symbolic variable representing the mechanism configuration, typically as either a length or angular dimension. It is time-varying, and is alternately termed a degree of freedom. When using the classic interface, the generalized coordinate dialog is used to create the symbolic variable, which is later selected in the frame or vector dialogs as a dimension.

:param initial: numeric

Initial value for the generalized coordinate

:param description: string
