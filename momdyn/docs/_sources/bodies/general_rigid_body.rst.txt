General Rigid Body
==================

A general rigid body has its center of gravity (CG) located at a user-specified point and orientation defined in a specified frame, a fixed mass, and specified inertia tensor.

**Keyword Arguments**

:param name: string

Key to be used when referencing this body.

:param ref_point_key: string

Key of the point at which this body's CG is located.

:param ref_frame_key: string

Key of the frame to which this body orientation is defined.

:param mass: numeric

Mass of this body.

:param ixx: numeric

Moment of inertia (MOI) of this body defined relative to its CG about the reference frame's X-axis.

:param iyy: numeric

MOI of this body defined relative to its CG about the reference frame's Y-axis.

:param izz: numeric

MOI of this body defined relative to its CG about the reference frame's Z-axis.

:param ixy: numeric

Product of inertia (POI) of this body defined relative to its CG in the reference frame's X- and Y-axes.

:param iyz: numeric

POI of this body defined relative to its CG in the reference frame's Y- and Z-axes.
