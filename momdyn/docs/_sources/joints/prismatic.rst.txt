Prismatic
=========

A prismatic joint creates a point that is translated relative to an existing point with vector components defined in a specified reference frame. The joint is analogous to creating a vector and point using the classic interface. The vector component can be constant valued, or a degree of freedom (DOF) may be generated where the point can translate in the unit vector direction. If the DOF form is chosen, then an optional linear stiffness, damping, and equilibrium distance can be used to include translational spring-damper physics in the joint.

**Keyword Arguments**

:param name: string

Name given to the joint, default is uppercase characters in alphabetical order (A, B, C, ...)

:param ref_point_key: string

Start point from which the vector component of the joint is defined

:param ref_frame_key: string

Reference frame in which the components of the vector are defined, with basis vectors e_x, e_y, and e_z

:param is_form: string

'constant' or 'degree of freedom'

**Vector Components**

:param x: numeric

Component of the unit vector measured in the x-axis of the reference frame

:param y: numeric

Component of the unit vector measured in the y-axis of the reference frame

:param z: numeric

Component of the unit vector measured in the z-axis of the reference frame

**Initial States**

:param value: numeric

Initial value for the generalized coordinate if is_form == 'degree of freedom'

:param rate: numeric

Initial value for the generalized speed if is_form == 'degree of freedom'

**Spring Parameters**

:param k: numeric

Spring constant

:param c: numeric

Damping constant

:param equilibrium: numeric

Equilibrium distance

:return: string
